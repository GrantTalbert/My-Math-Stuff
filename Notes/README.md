# Notes
These are just notes I took in my math classes.
I will note that (at least for the classes I've posted about as of 4/2/2024) my notation gets significantly less advanced as I go through the material, because although initially I thought it was cool to know what an upside down A meant, I decided it was more important to take notes that can be easily understood than it was to further prove to myself that I understand the meaning of the statement "for all".
