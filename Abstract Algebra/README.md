# Abstract Algebra
I read online somewhere that abstract algebra was really hard because of how abstract it was, and I also got tired of Wikipedia articles talking about rings and groups and having absolutely no idea what it meant, so when my Calc professor gave out a paper that had (amongst other things) a recommended book for reading about algebra at an undergraduate level incase anyone was interested, I decided to start reading about it when I got really bored. Except I didn't go with her recommendation I found a [free textbook](http://abstract.ups.edu/) from a [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/z1pd66/good_intro_to_abstract_algebra_books/) because wow textbooks cost money and that's not something I have most of the time! Comparing it to the stuff some of my friends are doing, it doesn't seem like I'm missing a ton of material, but I generally don't believe a free textbook will be as indepth as an actual course in the subject, and I'm genuinely looking forward to taking algebra courses (probably next year!!!!).
Anyways the textbook is "Abstract Algebra: Theory and Applications" by Thomas W. Judson. I've been skipping over some of the things I found less interesting, like the programming excercises (and I intend to skip the chapters dedicated to the applications of group theory to cryptography and coding), but other than that I've been working through basically all of it and have *very suprisingly* used the material on average once a week. For example today I helped my friend solve a question that was on his exam that neither him nor I had seen anything similar to before, but after two hours we solved it. Wow I'm very off track why am I rambling so much in a readme doc lmao
