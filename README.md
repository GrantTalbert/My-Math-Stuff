# My Math Stuff
Lots of stuff I did while bored and just random math things I've done (and a quantum computing thing but I didn't get far beyond the math there so I just shoved it in here)  
Most of the LaTeX for my notes comes from this [LaTeX template](https://github.com/sleepymalc/LaTeX-Template), although I've been adapting and modifying it throughout the year, and next year I want to try and make my own notes template that will work better for my setup.  
(as of 4/3/2024) To anyone who happens to stumble across this github page - its currently incomplete, I still have more stuff to put in here and stuff to update.
