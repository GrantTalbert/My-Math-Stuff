# My Math Stuff
Lots of stuff I did while bored and just random math things I've done (and a quantum computing thing but I didn't get far beyond the math there so I just shoved it in here)  
4/5/24 - I finally made my own LaTeX template! It's still very barebones, but I'm very happy with how it looks, and prefer it to the more colorful template I was previously using. I also started using one global header.tex file for all documents, so some of my notes documents have random lines in the preamble that ensure backwards compatability. My current setup is heavily inspired by [Gilles Castel](https://castel.dev/)'s LaTeX setup, the color scheme is somewhat inspired by [these incredible notes](https://github.com/dog-blood/utterly-unorganized-latex-code/tree/main) (although the code for them is TERRIFYING).  
(as of 4/3/2024) To anyone who happens to stumble across this github page - its currently incomplete, I still have more stuff to put in here and stuff to update.
